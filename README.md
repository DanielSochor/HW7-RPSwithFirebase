# Rock Paper Scissors Game using Firebase

This is an online two player Rock Paper Scissors game. Howâ€™s how the game works:

  * Both players pick either `rock`, `paper` or `scissors`. The game logs each choice to Firebase and also logs who selected first. After the players make their selection, the game will tell them whether a tie occurred or if one player defeated the other. 

  * The game will track each player's wins and losses.

  * During the game each player can chat with the other in the chat window at the bottom of the page.

We hope you enjoy this game!
